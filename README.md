## How to use this

1. Go to "releases" tab and download the newest release.zip 
2. Unpack release.zip anywhere you want
3. Copy retroarch.hmod and the cores you want (.hmod files from cores and extra_cores folders) to user_mods directory of Hakchi2.
4. Install the modules (all modules can be installed in one go) via Hakchi2's Modules menu.
5. Add the games as usual

Please note:
- To add RetroArch shortcut to NES Mini's shell, drag-and-drop CloverApp.zip to Hakchi2
- To make your own RetroArch modules, use the structure from libretro_core_template.zip. Use exisiting modules as a reference.
- To add your own BIOS images for custom cores, use bios_template.zip (please read the readme.txt inside).
- If the file extension of your game is not supported by Hakchi2, you may need to change the path in command line arguments (in Hakchi2's game options) to make it point to the corresponding core
- To use RetroArch for any NES game, just add "--retroarch" to command line arguments. If you need to load the game with specific NES core, use "--retroarch --core fceumm" to use FCEUmm for this game or "--retroarch --core nestopia" to use Nestopia
- To use Nestopia instead of FCEUmm, install use_nestopia.hmod module
- To use PicoDrive for all Genesis/Mega Drive games instead of Genesis Plus GX, install use_picodrive.hmod module. Make sure that picodrive module is installed before installing use_picodrive!
- To use SNES9x2005 for all SNES games instead of SNES9x2010, install use_snes9x2005.hmod module. Make sure that snes9x2005 module is installed before installing use_snes9x2005!
- To use SNES9x2002 for all SNES games instead of SNES9x2010, install use_snes9x2002.hmod module. Make sure that snes9x2002 module is installed before installing use_snes9x2002!
- To use Mupen64Plus for all N64 games instead of GLupeN64, install use_mupen64plus.hmod module. Make sure that mupen64plus module is installed before installing use_mupen64plus!
- You can re-enable bilinear filtering in RetroArch's settings (Settings —> Video —> Bilinear Filtering)
- If you want to use RetroArch's XMB UI instead of RGUI, install xmb_assets.hmod and change Menu Driver in Settings —> Driver —> Menu Driver to "xmb"
